# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Planning & Execution Process

### 1. Initial Planning

- Think through the problem thoroughly
- Read the codebase for relevant files
- Write a detailed plan to [tasks/todo.md](tasks/todo.md)
- The plan should include a checklist of todo items

### 2. Plan Verification

- Present the plan and check in before beginning work
- Wait for verification and approval

### 3. Implementation

- Work through todo items sequentially
- Mark each item as complete as you progress
- Provide high-level explanations for each change

### 4. Review & Documentation

- Add a review section to [tasks/todo.md](tasks/todo.md)
- Include a summary of all changes made
- Document any other relevant information

## Core Development Principles

### Simplicity First

- Make every task and code change as simple as possible
- Avoid massive or complex changes
- Each change should impact as little code as possible
- Only modify code that is directly relevant to the task
- Goal: Minimize the risk of introducing bugs

### Quality Standards

- **NO LAZY SOLUTIONS**: Find the root cause of bugs and fix them properly
- **NO TEMPORARY FIXES**: Implement permanent, robust solutions
- **SENIOR DEVELOPER MINDSET**: Think deeply, code carefully, test thoroughly
- **IMPACT MINIMIZATION**: Changes should only affect necessary code
- **BUG PREVENTION**: Simplicity is the key to avoiding new bugs
