Develop a detailed execution plan with task breakdowns and dependencies to build a web application following the client-server architecture, written in JavaScript. The plan should cover both server-side and client-side development, including setup, implementation, and testing phases. Below are the requirements for each component:

**Server-Side Requirements:**
- **Technical Stack:**
  - Node.js with Express.js as the server framework.
  - RESTful APIs for communication.
  - Swagger JSON for API documentation.
  - MongoDB with Mongoose for database management.
  - Basic JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for securing endpoints.
- **Main Features:**
  - Define and implement RESTful APIs (e.g., endpoints for user management, data retrieval, etc.—suggest a few examples if not fully specified).
  - Feature 1: [Placeholder—e.g., "User registration and login"].
  - Feature 2: [Placeholder—e.g., "Data creation and retrieval"].
- **Expectations:**
  - Include database schema design.
  - Provide sample API endpoint definitions (e.g., GET /users, POST /data).
  - Outline authentication flow (e.g., token generation and validation).

**Client-Side Requirements:**
- **Technical Stack:**
  - ReactJS, initialized with Vite (JavaScript template).
  - Redux with Redux-Saga for state management.
  - TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Main Features:**
  - Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data, interacting with server APIs.
  - TODO: Define GUI features (e.g., a dashboard, form inputs, data tables—suggest a few examples if not fully specified).
- **Expectations:**
  - Include a basic component structure (e.g., layout, pages, reusable components).
  - Describe how state management integrates with API calls.

**Execution Plan Guidelines:**
- Break tasks into phases (e.g., setup, development, testing).
- Identify dependencies between tasks.
- Suggest tools or libraries for testing (e.g., Jest, Postman).
- Highlight any potential challenges (e.g., CORS issues, authentication edge cases) and mitigation strategies.
- If specific APIs or GUI features are undefined, propose reasonable defaults and note them as assumptions.

Provide the response in a clear, organized format (e.g., tables, bullet points, or sections) suitable for a development team to follow.
