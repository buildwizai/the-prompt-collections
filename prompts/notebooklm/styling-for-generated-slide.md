Generate the document based on the following styling guideline:

1. **Color Palette (Strictly Limited):** Use only four core colors: Black, White, Gray, and Bright Green.
2. **Aesthetic:** Maintain an elegant, clear, clean, and professional design language.
3. **Visual Depth:** Incorporate visual depth using elements like blocks, lines, borders, and subtle shadows to achieve a 3D effect.
4. **Bright Green Usage Constraint:** The Bright Green color is strictly reserved for highlights (text, borders, or lines); it must *never* be used as a background color.
5. **System Status Colors:** Standardized colors for danger, informational, and warning states may only be applied to text elements, not backgrounds or primary UI components.
