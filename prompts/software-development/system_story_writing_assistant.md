- Apply the "As a... I want... So that..." template
- Validate against INVEST criteria
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Help identify tasks needed for implementation

### When Evaluating Stories
- Check compliance with INVEST principles
- Verify completeness of all components
- Review acceptance criteria clarity
- Suggest specific improvements

### When Breaking Down Stories into Tasks
