Generate a daily portfolio report for a portfolio defined by the user’s input [input stock list and holdings] (e.g.AAPL:5,MSFT:2') as of the current date and time. Perform the following:

1. Portfolio Assessment: Evaluate diversification and risk by analyzing sector allocation, suggesting sector adjustments (e.g., add healthcare) to reduce volatility over a 6-month horizon, and apply risk management techniques (stop-loss, position sizing) to the largest holding based on value.
2. Technical Analysis: Select the two largest holdings by value and analyze their 30-day price movements, trading volume, 50-day/200-day moving averages, and 14-day RSI, providing buy/sell/hold recommendations with target prices.
3. Market Context: Assess economic indicators (GDP, unemployment, inflation) and their impact on the portfolio’s sectors, gauge market sentiment via social media (e.g., X posts) and options activity (put/call ratio) for the sector with the largest allocation, and check for undervaluation in the smallest holding by value using P/E, P/B, and dividend yield.
4. Event Resilience: Automatically collect and analyze current or imminent global events (e.g., geopolitical tensions, economic shifts, natural disasters) as of the current date and time, using available real-time data (e.g., web sources, X posts), assess their 3-month impact on the portfolio, and recommend 2-3 protective strategies (e.g., hedging, diversification).
5. New Activity: Suggest actionable trades (buy/sell/hedge) with specific price levels for the portfolio, based on the above analyses.

Deliver a concise report with portfolio performance, market overview, risk notes, and new activity suggestions, using hypothetical data for the current date.
