Compare and contrast growth stocks and dividend stocks by defining their characteristics, evaluating their benefits and risks, and suggesting specific investor scenarios where one outperforms the other over a 12-month horizon. Reference a specified growth stock [(e.g., Tesla)] and dividend stock [(e.g., Coca-Cola)], using hypothetical current market data, to illustrate how each aligns with different financial goals and risk tolerances.
